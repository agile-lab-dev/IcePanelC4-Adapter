## Overview

This project provides integration between Witboost and [Ice Panel](https://icepanel.io/) to automatically generate a C4 architectural diagram representing the entire ecosystem of Data Products and their internal implementation.

### Details

In a C4 representation, the Data Product is a system. Ice Panel offers a multi-layer visualization where is also possible to explore multiple domains within the same layer, this is a perfect fit for a Data Mesh representation, because systems can be grouped in domains and then it is possible to zoom in each system ( Data Product ) to discover the inner architecture.

## Building

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.11
- Poetry

**Installing**:

To set up a Python environment we use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/):

```
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

Once Poetry is installed and in your `$PATH`, you can execute the following:

```
poetry --version
```

If you see something like `Poetry (version x.x.x)`, your install is ready to use!

Install the dependencies defined in `specific-provisioner/pyproject.toml`:
```
cd specific-provisioner
poetry install
```

*Note:* All the following commands are to be run in the Poetry project directory with the virtualenv enabled.

**Type check:** is handled by mypy:

```bash
poetry run mypy src/
```

**Tests:** are handled by pytest:

```bash
poetry run pytest --cov=src/ tests/. --cov-report=xml
```

**Artifacts & Docker image:** the project leverages Poetry for packaging. Build package with:

```
poetry build
```

The Docker image can be built with:

```
docker build .
```

More details can be found [here](specific-provisioner/docs/docker.md).

*Note:* the version for the project is automatically computed using information gathered from Git, using branch name and tags. Unless you are on a release branch `1.2.x` or a tag `v1.2.3` it will end up being `0.0.0`. You can follow this branch/tag convention or update the version computation to match your preferred strategy.

**CI/CD:** the pipeline is based on GitLab CI as that's what we use internally. It's configured by the `.gitlab-ci.yaml` file in the root of the repository. You can use that as a starting point for your customizations.

## Running

To run the server locally, use:

```bash
cd specific-provisioner
source $(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate # only needed if venv is not already enabled
uvicorn src.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8091
```

By default, the server binds to port 8091 on localhost. After it's up and running you can make provisioning requests to this address. You can also check the API documentation served [here](http://127.0.0.1:8091/docs).



## Deploying

This microservice is meant to be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster with the included Helm chart and the scripts that can be found in the `helm` subdirectory. You can find more details [here](helm/README.md).
