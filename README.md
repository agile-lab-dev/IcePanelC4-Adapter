## Overview

This project provides a scaffold to develop a Specific Provisioner from scratch using Python & FastAPI.

### What's a Specific Provisioner?

A Specific Provisioner is a microservice which is in charge of deploying components that use a specific technology. When the deployment of a Data Product is triggered, the platform generates it descriptor and orchestrates the deployment of every component contained in the Data Product. For every such component the platform knows which Specific Provisioner is responsible for its deployment, and can thus send a provisioning request with the descriptor to it so that the Specific Provisioner can perform whatever operation is required to fulfill this request and report back the outcome to the platform.

You can learn more about how the Specific Provisioners fit in the broader picture [here](https://docs.witboost.agilelab.it/docs/p2_arch/p1_intro/#deploy-flow).

### Software stack

This microservice is written in Python 3.11, using FastAPI for the HTTP layer. Project is built with Poetry and supports packaging as Wheel and Docker image, ideal for Kubernetes deployments (which is the preferred option).

## Building

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.11
- Poetry

**Installing**:

To set up a Python environment we use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/):

```
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

Once Poetry is installed and in your `$PATH`, you can execute the following:

```
poetry --version
```

If you see something like `Poetry (version x.x.x)`, your install is ready to use!

Install the dependencies defined in `specific-provisioner/pyproject.toml`:
```
cd specific-provisioner
poetry install
```

*Note:* All the following commands are to be run in the Poetry project directory with the virtualenv enabled.

**Type check:** is handled by mypy:

```bash
poetry run mypy src/
```

**Tests:** are handled by pytest:

```bash
poetry run pytest --cov=src/ tests/. --cov-report=xml
```

**Artifacts & Docker image:** the project leverages Poetry for packaging. Build package with:

```
poetry build
```

The Docker image can be built with:

```
docker build .
```

More details can be found [here](specific-provisioner/docs/docker.md).

*Note:* the version for the project is automatically computed using information gathered from Git, using branch name and tags. Unless you are on a release branch `1.2.x` or a tag `v1.2.3` it will end up being `0.0.0`. You can follow this branch/tag convention or update the version computation to match your preferred strategy.

**CI/CD:** the pipeline is based on GitLab CI as that's what we use internally. It's configured by the `.gitlab-ci.yaml` file in the root of the repository. You can use that as a starting point for your customizations.

## Running

To run the server locally, use:

```bash
cd specific-provisioner
source $(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate # only needed if venv is not already enabled
uvicorn src.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8091
```

By default, the server binds to port 8091 on localhost. After it's up and running you can make provisioning requests to this address. You can also check the API documentation served [here](http://127.0.0.1:8091/docs).

## Deploying

This microservice is meant to be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster with the included Helm chart and the scripts that can be found in the `helm` subdirectory. You can find more details [here](helm/README.md).
